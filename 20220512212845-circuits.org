* Electrical circuits
** Current
Electric current is the rate of flow of electrical charge.
*** Calculating current
You can calculate current with the formula
Current is measured in Amps(A) and is represented as 'I'.

$Current in Amps = \frac{charge in Coulombs}{time in seconds}$
or:
$I = \frac{Q}{T}$
