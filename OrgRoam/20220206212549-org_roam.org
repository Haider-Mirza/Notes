* About
One of the best ways to think and work through problems is to have a written dialogue with yourself. Using OrgRoam you have a better way to log your thoughts from the day, link them to existing notes, and easily review the notes for any day, all with Org Roam.

* NOTE:
To install, make sure you have gcc AND gcc-toolchain installed.

* Important information
+ In my configuration my Org roam notes go to the *~/Notes/* directory.
